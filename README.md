# Graph Theorist Sketchpad
Created for WSU MATH 453 Graph Theory. Made entirely with C in Raylib and Raygui. Has its own collision detection system using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy Tree.
This is definitely a "runs on my machine" kind of project, however, if you have a mac, Xcode, and some spare time, you can try to run it by cloning the Raygui repo
